# BluePaint
Creative Technology Project for James Deering, 13037898
Standard Unity project: open in Unity 5.3.3. 
In Paint mode: left click paints, right click clones the current pixel's colour.
Only toggle 'global shaders' bool in the Camera's script if you're creating a small image (think 5x5)
WASD moves the camera, scroll wheel zooms it
Click on the Camera game object in the Hierarchy to access the script
To load an image, place it in the Resource folder, drag and drop it into the corresponding load box in the camera script, and
place the image's dimensions in the boxes underneath. Make sure to change the image's properties to 'advanced' and check 'read/write enabled'
